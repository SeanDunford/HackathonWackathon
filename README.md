==================

Just keep hacking and wacking and smacking. 
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He just hacks, whacks, choppin’ that meat

Butcher Pete’s got a long sharp knife
He starts choppin’ and don’t know when to stop
All you fellas gotta watch your wives
‘Cause Pete don’t care whose meat he chops

Just keep hacking and wacking and smacking. 
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He just hacks, whacks, choppin’ that meat

Ever since Pete flew into town
He’s been havin’ a ball
Just cuttin’ and choppin’ for miles around
Single women, married women, old maids and all

Just keep hacking and wacking and smacking. 
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He just hacks, whacks, choppin’ that meat

Wakes up in the morning, half past five
Chops from sunrise to sunset
I don’t see how he stays alive
Meat’s gonna be the death of ole Pete yet

Just keep hacking and wacking and smacking. 
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He just hacks, whacks, choppin’ that meat

The police put Pete in jail
Yes, he finally met his fate
But when they came to pay his bail
They found him choppin’ on his cell mate

Just keep hacking and wacking and smacking. 
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He keeps hackin’ and whackin’ and smackin’
He just hacks, whacks, choppin’ that meat

That Butcher Pete is a crazy man
Tries to chop down the wind and the rain
Just hacks on anything he can get
Say, turn this record over, you ain’t heard nothing yet
